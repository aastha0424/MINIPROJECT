# MINIPROJECT
Our project focuses on developing a language translation website to facilitate seamless communication across different languages.
We integrate a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as Python, Flask, Pillow, OpenCV, Tesseract, Pytesseract, and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to ensure efficient functionality.
Users interact with the website interface, inputting text or uploading images containing text.
Through the utilization of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, powered by Tesseract and Pytesseract, the website accurately extracts text from uploaded images.
The extracted text is then translated into the user's desired language, promoting inclusivity and accessibility to information.
Additionally, users have the option to convert the translated text into audio format using gTTS, catering to auditory learners and individuals with visual impairments.
